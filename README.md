Simple web app with Django and the CoinGecko API to check out crypto data. It's got:

- A bar chart showing current prices for the top 10 coins, sorted from highest to lowest (log scale so it's easier to read).

- A line chart for 7-day trends on the top 5, all normalized to percentages so you can compare them without the scales messing things up.

- A handy table with stuff like market cap and 24h changesâ€”super responsive too.



Used Python/Django, Chart.js for the fun interactive charts, Bootstrap to make it look better.
